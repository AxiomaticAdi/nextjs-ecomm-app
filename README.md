# Spooky Paws

Welcome to [Spooky Paws](https://spooky-paws-ecomm.vercel.app/) - a whimsical e-commerce store that specializes in Halloween costumes for furry friends.

## Objective

The primary goal behind Spooky Paws was to design a mock e-commerce platform integrating front-end and back-end technologies for a complete online shopping experience. This project served as my initial venture into building applications with an authentic back end.

## Technologies Used

-   **Front-end:** Next.js with TypeScript
-   **Back-end:** Prisma with MongoDB
-   **Authentication:** NextAuth
-   **Hosting:** Vercel

## Learnings

1. **Anonymous & User Carts:** Built a system for managing shopping carts for both anonymous and logged-in users, ensuring a seamless shopping experience.
2. **User Authentication with NextAuth:** Integrated user authentication using NextAuth, for a more secure shopping experience and to enable saving carts for future use.
3. **Mobile-friendly UI:** Emphasized on a responsive design to ensure that Spooky Paws looks spooky-good on devices of all sizes.
